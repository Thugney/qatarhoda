LOGO SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
========================

The logo has been integrated into the website. Here's what you need to do:

1. SAVE THE LOGO IMAGE:
   - Save the DohaNordic logo image you provided as: logo.png
   - Place it in the main project directory: /home/user/qatarhoda/logo.png
   - Recommended size: 500x500px or larger (will be auto-resized)

2. LOGO APPEARS IN:
   ✓ Top center of all pages (50px height, auto-scales on hover)
   ✓ Browser tab favicon (16x16, 32x32, 180x180 sizes)
   ✓ Apple touch icon (for iOS devices)
   ✓ Gradient text "NordCloud Qatar" appears next to logo on desktop

3. LOGO FEATURES:
   - Cyan glow effect matching site theme
   - Hover animation (glows brighter, scales up 5%)
   - Links back to homepage
   - Responsive: logo only on mobile, logo + text on desktop
   - Fixed position at top center

4. IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE PNG FILE:
   Option A: Convert the image you uploaded to PNG format
   Option B: I can create a simple SVG version if needed

5. ALTERNATIVE: Use online converter
   - Go to: https://image.online-convert.com/convert-to-png
   - Upload your logo image
   - Download as PNG
   - Rename to "logo.png"
   - Place in project root

Let me know if you need help converting the image or want me to create an SVG version!
